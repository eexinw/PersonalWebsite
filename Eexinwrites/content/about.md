I'm Eexin, a Malaysian based in Kuala Lumpur and (currently in) Hong Kong. 

I have spent the past ten years leading strategy, product and operations teams in pre-series A startups (digital mental health) and in large tech companies (Grab). I love solving problems and doing things hands-on, and am constantly looking out for interesting projects to work on. I am excited for new adventures in the coming decade!

Outside of work, I enjoy rock-climbing, reading and writing. I love watching a good play. I am curious about a wide array of topics -- essays here are attempts to develop some of these thoughts or ideas and to crystallise experiences which are important to me.

Some other formative experiences:
- **Career break**: I spent six months traipsing around USA and parts of Europe revisiting old friends, climbing and diving  
- **Grab**: I built a team of high-performers, and had the privilege of working with them on a lot of fun projects for five years
- **Bain**: The three years I spent in Bain fresh out of college are foundational to where I am today
- **University of Chicago**: Most business problems are constrained optimisation problems  
- **Southeast Asia, USA, South Africa, Hong Kong**: All places I have spent a significant amount of time in, and have fond memories of
