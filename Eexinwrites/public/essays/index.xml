      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard the call of leadership duty was when I was explaining the context and motivations behind a huge tedious regulatory project and halfway through, I realized that people were listening. Not with the usual glazed eyes and the non-committal “I heard you” nods but with the intense gaze of a team who was hungry and ready to rally behind a flag I did not know I possessed. It was more an honest plea rather than a war cry on my part - I sensed that the team was tired, we had a momentous task at hand and I gathered the words to try to make sense of it for them, as I would have done for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
